# Binary Tree Traversal

This Go program demonstrates a basic binary tree traversal using Depth-First Search (DFS).

## Overview

The program defines a `Node` struct that represents nodes in a binary tree. The `traverse` method is used to perform DFS traversal, printing the value of each node.

## How It Works

Binary tree traversal involves visiting each node in a specific order without revisiting nodes. In this program:

- **Node Struct**: Defines a node with an integer value and pointers to left and right child nodes.
- **traverse Method**: Implements DFS traversal recursively. It prints the value of the current node, then traverses its left and right children.

## Usage

1. **Clone Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. **Build**: Compile and build the Go program using `go build`.
3. **Run**: Execute the built binary to see the binary tree traversal in action.
